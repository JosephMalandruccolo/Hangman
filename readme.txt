This project is a simple Hangman Game assigned as homework in the Fall 2012 Data Structures course in the University of Chicago M.S. CS program.
To run this code, copy the hw3 directory into the src folder of a new project in your favorite Java editor (mine is Eclipse) and run the main method in HangmanMVC.java
Open Issues:
HangmanInitialWindow.java is broken - this code was intended to serve as an initial screen which would allow the user to select the number of guesses she wanted to have. As of this commit, no other .java file in this project depends on this file.
